If ya need any extra you'll have to buy it from me.
I'll be heading out to Redwater Crossing soon — you should follow if you value your life...

The zombies came faster than I expected. Broke down our brittle walls.
I fought them off until the halls burned and hid up here on the roof when I ran out of bullets.

I couldn’t reach Jade in time. He’s alive, but barely.
The ones who took him are nesting in the lower bunker.
Save him — he’s important.

Jade’s condition? Kidnapped, most likely.
Go find out yourself — too many zombies down there.
Until then, that’s the best diagnosis you’re getting.
